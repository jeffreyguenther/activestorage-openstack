## Usage

```
dev_openstack:
  service: OpenStack
  container: <container name>
  credentials: #you can put what you want here and it will be directly passed to `Fog::Storage::OpenStack.new`
    openstack_auth_url: <auth url>
    openstack_username: <username>

the `Temp-URL-Key` on the container or account. Depending on your OpenStack
provider, you'll likely have to use the CLI tools to set this value.
